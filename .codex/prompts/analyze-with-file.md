# Codex Analyze-With-File Workflow

## Quick Start

Interactive collaborative analysis workflow with **documented discussion process**. Records understanding evolution, facilitates multi-round Q&A, and uses CLI tools for deep exploration.

**Core workflow**: Topic → Explore → Discuss → Document → Refine → Conclude

## Overview

This workflow enables iterative exploration and refinement of complex topics through sequential phases:

1. **Topic Understanding** - Parse the topic and identify analysis dimensions
2. **CLI Exploration** - Gather codebase context and perform deep analysis via Gemini
3. **Interactive Discussion** - Multi-round Q&A with user feedback and direction adjustments
4. **Synthesis & Conclusion** - Consolidate insights and generate actionable recommendations

The key innovation is **documented discussion timeline** that captures the evolution of understanding across all phases, enabling users to track how insights develop and assumptions are corrected.

## Analysis Flow

```
Session Detection
   ├─ Check if analysis session exists for topic
   ├─ EXISTS + discussion.md → Continue mode
   └─ NOT_FOUND → New session mode

Phase 1: Topic Understanding
   ├─ Parse topic/question
   ├─ Identify analysis dimensions (architecture, implementation, performance, security, concept, comparison, decision)
   ├─ Initial scoping with user (focus areas, analysis depth)
   └─ Initialize discussion.md

Phase 2: CLI Exploration (Serial Execution)
   ├─ Codebase context gathering (project structure, related files, constraints)
   ├─ Gemini CLI analysis (build on codebase findings)
   └─ Aggregate findings into explorations.json

Phase 3: Interactive Discussion (Multi-Round)
   ├─ Present exploration findings to user
   ├─ Gather user feedback (deepen, adjust direction, ask questions, complete)
   ├─ Execute targeted CLI analysis based on user direction
   ├─ Update discussion.md with each round
   └─ Repeat until clarity achieved (max 5 rounds)

Phase 4: Synthesis & Conclusion
   ├─ Consolidate all insights and discussion rounds
   ├─ Generate final conclusions with recommendations
   ├─ Update discussion.md with synthesis
   └─ Offer follow-up options (create issue, generate task, export report)
```

## Implementation Details

### Session Initialization

The workflow automatically generates a unique session identifier and directory structure based on the topic and current date (UTC+8).

**Session ID Format**: `ANL-{slug}-{date}`
- `slug`: Lowercase alphanumeric + Chinese characters, max 40 chars (derived from topic)
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD format (UTC+8)

**Session Directory**: `.workflow/.analysis/{sessionId}/`

**Auto-Detection**: If session folder exists with discussion.md, automatically enters continue mode. Otherwise, creates new session.

**Session Variables**:
- `sessionId`: Unique identifier
- `sessionFolder`: Base directory for artifacts
- `mode`: "new" or "continue"
- `dimensions`: Analysis focus areas
- `focusAreas`: User-selected focus areas
- `analysisDepth`: quick|standard|deep

---

## Phase 1: Topic Understanding

**Objective**: Parse the topic, identify relevant analysis dimensions, scope the analysis with user input, and initialize the discussion document.

### Step 1.1: Parse Topic & Identify Dimensions

The workflow analyzes the topic text against predefined analysis dimensions to determine relevant focus areas.

**Analysis Dimensions and Keywords**:

| Dimension | Keywords |
|-----------|----------|
| architecture | 架构, architecture, design, structure, 设计, pattern |
| implementation | 实现, implement, code, coding, 代码, logic |
| performance | 性能, performance, optimize, bottleneck, 优化, speed |
| security | 安全, security, auth, permission, 权限, vulnerability |
| concept | 概念, concept, theory, principle, 原理, understand |
| comparison | 比较, compare, vs, difference, 区别, versus |
| decision | 决策, decision, choice, tradeoff, 选择, trade-off |

**Matching Logic**: Compare topic text against keyword lists. If multiple dimensions match, include all. If none match, default to "architecture" and "implementation".

### Step 1.2: Initial Scoping (New Session Only)

For new analysis sessions, gather user preferences before exploration:

**Focus Areas** (Multi-select):
- 代码实现 (Implementation details)
- 架构设计 (Architecture design)
- 最佳实践 (Best practices)
- 问题诊断 (Problem diagnosis)

**Analysis Depth** (Single-select):
- 快速概览 (Quick overview, 10-15 minutes)
- 标准分析 (Standard analysis, 30-60 minutes)
- 深度挖掘 (Deep dive, 1-2+ hours)

### Step 1.3: Initialize discussion.md

Create the main discussion document with session metadata, context, and placeholder sections.

**discussion.md Structure**:
- **Header**: Session ID, topic, start time, identified dimensions
- **Analysis Context**: User-selected focus areas, depth level, scope
- **Initial Questions**: Key questions to guide the analysis
- **Discussion Timeline**: Round-by-round findings and insights
- **Current Understanding**: To be populated after exploration

**Key Features**:
- Serves as the primary artifact throughout the workflow
- Captures all rounds of discussion and findings
- Documents assumption corrections and insight evolution
- Enables session continuity across multiple interactions

**Success Criteria**:
- Session folder created successfully
- discussion.md initialized with all metadata
- Analysis dimensions identified
- User preferences captured

## Phase 2: CLI Exploration

**Objective**: Gather codebase context and execute deep analysis via CLI tools to build understanding of the topic.

**Execution Model**: Sequential (serial) execution - gather codebase context first, then perform CLI analysis building on those findings.

### Step 2.1: Codebase Context Gathering

Use built-in tools to understand the codebase structure and identify relevant code related to the topic.

**Context Gathering Activities**:
1. **Get project structure** - Execute `ccw tool exec get_modules_by_depth '{}'` to understand module organization
2. **Search for related code** - Use Grep/Glob to find files matching topic keywords
3. **Read project tech context** - Load `.workflow/project-tech.json` if available for constraints and integration points
4. **Analyze patterns** - Identify common code patterns and architecture decisions

**exploration-codebase.json Structure**:
- `relevant_files[]`: Files related to the topic with relevance indicators
- `patterns[]`: Common code patterns and architectural styles identified
- `constraints[]`: Project-level constraints that affect the analysis
- `integration_points[]`: Key integration points between modules
- `_metadata`: Timestamp and context information

**Key Information to Capture**:
- Top 5-10 most relevant files with brief descriptions
- Recurring patterns in code organization and naming
- Project constraints (frameworks, architectural styles, tech stack)
- Integration patterns between modules
- Existing solutions or similar implementations

### Step 2.2: Gemini CLI Analysis

## Iteration Patterns

### First Analysis Session

```
User initiates: TOPIC="specific question"
   ├─ No session exists → New session mode
   ├─ Parse topic and identify dimensions
   ├─ Scope analysis with user (focus areas, depth)
   ├─ Create discussion.md
   ├─ Gather codebase context
   ├─ Execute Gemini CLI analysis
   ├─ Aggregate findings
   └─ Enter multi-round discussion loop
```

### Continue Existing Session

```
User resumes: TOPIC="same topic" with --continue flag
   ├─ Session exists → Continue mode
   ├─ Load previous discussion.md
   ├─ Load explorations.json
   └─ Resume from last discussion round
```

### Discussion Loop (Rounds 3-5)

```
Each round:
   ├─ Present current findings
   ├─ Gather user feedback
   ├─ Process response:
   │   ├─ Deepen → Deeper CLI analysis on same topic
   │   ├─ Adjust → New CLI analysis with adjusted focus
   │   ├─ Questions → CLI analysis answering specific questions
   │   └─ Complete → Exit loop for synthesis
   ├─ Update discussion.md
   └─ Repeat until user selects complete or max rounds reached
```

### Completion Flow

```
Final synthesis:
   ├─ Consolidate all insights
   ├─ Generate conclusions.json
   ├─ Update discussion.md with final synthesis
   ├─ Offer follow-up options
   └─ Archive session artifacts
```

## Best Practices

### Before Starting Analysis

1. **Clear Topic Definition**: Detailed topics lead to better dimension identification
2. **User Context**: Understanding focus preferences helps scope the analysis
3. **Scope Understanding**: Being clear about depth expectations sets correct analysis intensity

### During Analysis

1. **Review Findings**: Check exploration results before proceeding to discussion
2. **Document Assumptions**: Track what you think is true for correction later
3. **Use Continue Mode**: Resume sessions to build on previous findings rather than starting over
4. **Embrace Corrections**: Track wrong→right transformations as valuable learnings
5. **Iterate Thoughtfully**: Each discussion round should meaningfully refine understanding

### Documentation Practices

1. **Evidence-Based**: Every conclusion should reference specific code or patterns
2. **Confidence Levels**: Indicate confidence (high/medium/low) for conclusions
3. **Timeline Clarity**: Use clear timestamps for traceability
4. **Evolution Tracking**: Document how understanding changed across rounds
5. **Action Items**: Generate specific, actionable recommendations

## When to Use This Workflow

### Use analyze-with-file when:
- Exploring complex topics collaboratively with documented trail
- Need multi-round iterative refinement of understanding
- Decision-making requires exploring multiple perspectives
- Building shared understanding before implementation
- Want to document how understanding evolved

### Use direct execution when:
- Short, focused analysis tasks (single component)
- Clear, well-defined topics with limited scope
- Quick information gathering without iteration
- Quick follow-up to existing session

### Consider alternatives when:
- Specific bug diagnosis needed → use `workflow:debug-with-file`
- Generating new ideas/solutions → use `workflow:brainstorm-with-file`
- Complex planning with parallel perspectives → use `workflow:collaborative-plan-with-file`
- Ready to implement → use `workflow:lite-plan`
