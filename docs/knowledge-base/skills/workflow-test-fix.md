## Description

Unified test-fix orchestrator that combines **test planning generation** (Phase 1-4) with **iterative test-cycle execution** (Phase 5) into a single end-to-end pipeline. Creates test sessions with progressive L0-L3 test layers, generates test tasks, then executes them with adaptive fix cycles until pass rate >= 95% or max iterations reached.
