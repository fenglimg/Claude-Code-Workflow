# Fix Plan: memory:compact

1. (docs) Explicitly separate “slash runtime” vs “optional CLI” in the outline so `Bash(*)` is not implied by reference CLI snippets.
2. (docs) Tighten the “Path Resolution Rules” outline section: project root detection and absolute path conversion (best-effort vs required).
3. (docs) Add a minimal recovery snippet: show the returned `CMEM-...` id and how to export/search later via MCP.
