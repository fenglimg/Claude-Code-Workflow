# Requirement (non-leaky): /workflow:unified-execute-with-file

## Source

- Command doc (oracle, do not paste full contents into spec): `.claude/commands/workflow/unified-execute-with-file.md`

## Command Identity

- group: workflow
- name: unified-execute-with-file
- description: Universal execution engine for consuming any planning/brainstorm/analysis output with minimal progress tracking, multi-agent coordination, and incremental execution
- argument-hint: [-y|--yes] [<path>[,<path2>] | -p|--plan <path>[,<path2>]] [--auto-commit] [--commit-prefix \"prefix\"] [\"execution context or task name\"]
- allowed-tools: TodoWrite(*), Task(*), AskUserQuestion(*), Read(*), Grep(*), Glob(*), Bash(*), Edit(*), Write(*)

## Structure Hints (Headings Only)

  - Auto Mode
- Unified Execute-With-File Command
  - Quick Start
- Basic usage (auto-detect plan, ask for execution method)
- Execute with specific plan (no -p needed for default paths)
- Execute multiple plans sequentially (comma-separated)
- With explicit -p flag (still supported)
- With auto-commit (conventional commits)
- Auto mode (skip prompts, use Agent for simple tasks, CLI for complex)

## Hard Constraints (P0)

- Do not claim a pointer is `Existing` unless it is verifiable in the repo now.
- Evidence must be dual-source: docs (.claude/commands/**.md) + ts (ccw/src/**).
- If unsure, mark as `Planned` and add a concrete `Verify` step.
