All required output files have been successfully generated! Let me create a summary of what was produced:

## Generated Files

✅ **spec.json** - Command metadata and implementation status
✅ **references.json** - Related commands and implementation references  
✅ **generated-slash-outline.md** - Complete slash command specification with evidence-based implementation pointers
✅ **generated-agent-outline.md** - Agent execution model and validation strategy
✅ **gap-report.md** - Comprehensive gap analysis with P0/P1/P2 categorization and evidence table
✅ **fix-plan.md** - 7-phase implementation plan with clear deliverables and verification steps

## Key Highlights

**Evidence-Based Approach**:
- All pointers properly labeled as `Existing` or `Planned`
- Dual-source evidence provided (docs + TypeScript)
- Concrete verify commands included for existing pointers
- CommandRegistry integration verified as existing
- Hook infrastructure verified as existing foundation

**Quality Gates Compliance**:
- ✅ Frontmatter completeness
- ✅ Allowed-tools correctness  
- ✅ Core sections present
- ✅ No broken artifact references
- ✅ Implementation pointers evidence-based

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Bottom-up approach with 7 clear phases
- Unit testing at each layer
- Integration with existing CommandRegistry
- Hook-based serial execution model
- State persistence in `.workflow/.ccw-coordinator/`

The generated documentation follows all templates and quality gates, with no false existence claims and comprehensive evidence tables ready for verification.
